Hi, Iâ€™m @Pauligrinder, aka. Pauli Kettunen

Before you ask, no, my nickname doesn't have anything to do with Grinder.
Some of my friends came up with it way before said service existed.
It stems from the fact that I look a lot like George Fisher (Corpsegrinder), of the band Cannibal Corpse.

I'm a mobile application developer. I started of as a Windows Phone developer, but when that started to die I jumped ship and specialized on Android.
Many years later it became fesible to do cross platform apps in React-Native and since then that has become my main focus.
These days I'm also in charge of iOS development at my workplace, but that is mostly covered by React-Native as well.

I'm also interested in other kinds of programming projects. On my spare time I mess around with SBC's. At the moment I'm running a NanoPi Neo3, but I also have a couple of Raspberry Pi 2's, a Raspberry Pi Zero W and the OG Raspberry Pi 1 sitting on shelf. My SBC usage is mostly light NAS stuff (serving media files to Android TV etc), but I have also developed some simple Django/Python backend stuff that runs on it. 
I have also done some simple web pages (using React and some older technologies), Windows desktop applications ... and even some cloud service stuff.

My hobbies include: 
- Playing music. Mostly guitar, which I started in 2003, but sometimes also drums, bass... And I also like to make midi orchestrations
- Gardening stuff - which I actually hate but it's gotta be done
- Brewing and drinking beer
- Cooking, particularly pizza and bbq stuff

If you need to contact me, I'm sure you'll find a way ;) I'm all over the place.
